# Gutter Polish Plan (archived)

> **Status: complete and superseded.** All 15 polish phases shipped. Forward planning lives in [`docs/plans/master_plan.md`](../plans/master_plan.md) (hard fork → rebrand → encryption Phase 1). Post-polish work since this doc was frozen: multi-root workspace, snippets, templates with seeded defaults, tag system, version history, reading mode, heading fold, open-file-from-OS, save/discard/cancel dialog, plus the 0.9.0 security audit fixes.

## Execution Order

12 → 13 → 14 → 15

## Upcoming Phases

### Phase 12: Templates

Built-in templates for common document types. Templates are just markdown files stored in `.gutter/templates/`. Ships with useful defaults (meeting notes, journal entry, project brief, etc.). "New from Template" in file tree context menu and unified search. "Save as Template" on any open document. Users can edit/delete custom templates.

**Details:** [`docs/plans/phase-12-templates.md`](docs/plans/phase-12-templates.md)

### Phase 13: Tag System

Frontmatter tags become a first-class organizational primitive — tag store, tag browser panel, tag autocomplete in frontmatter, tag search integration, cloud/list view.

**Details:** [`docs/plans/phase-13-tags.md`](docs/plans/phase-13-tags.md)

### Phase 14: Version History

Two-layer version history. **Snapshots** (always active): automatic on every save, SHA-256 dedup, 30s debounce, unpinned auto-delete after 24h, pin to keep forever with optional name/description. **Git history** (if workspace has `.git`): read-only view of commits that touched the file — we never auto-commit or modify the repo. Unified history panel shows both layers side by side.

**Details:** [`docs/plans/phase-14-version-history.md`](docs/plans/phase-14-version-history.md)

### Phase 15: Reading Mode with Marginalia

Non-editable, book-typeset view (`Cmd+Shift+R`). Comments render as margin annotations alongside anchor text — not in a sidebar. CSS grid layout with content + margin columns. No chrome, no cursor — the landing page screenshot.

**Details:** [`docs/plans/phase-15-reading-mode.md`](docs/plans/phase-15-reading-mode.md)
